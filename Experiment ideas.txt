For dataset in (BloodMNIST, DermaMNIST, OrganAMNIST, OrganCMNIST, OrganSMNIST):
    for num_labels_per_class in (1,10,100):
        Find baseline (JEM) ACC, ECE, Confidence Histogram and Reliability Diagram
        Also plot training and validation acc graph for further study

    for num_labels_per_class in (1,10,100):
        for query_size in (lower 1%, lower 5%, lower 10%):
            Find ACC, ECE, Confidence Histogram and Reliability Diagram using AL
            Also plot training and validation acc graph for further study
        for query_size (labels per class) in (10, 100):
            Find ACC, ECE, Confidence Histogram and Reliability Diagram using AL
            Also plot training and validation acc graph for further study

total number of experiments: 5*(3+3*(3+2)) = 90
total number of experiments per dataset: 18

(num_labels_per_class, acc using JEM) --> [(1,~50%), (10, ~75%), (100, ~90%)]

Expected results:
    Improved acc (obviously): more data, better acc
    Better callibration (lower ECE)
    The higher the starting num_labels_per_class, the lower nums of query_size (and calls) are needed
